## Announcement
In compliance with the latest requirements from the ERCF V2 team, the SIBOOR ERCF V2 GitHub repository will only host STL files created or modified by SIBOOR. For all other STL files, please download them from the official ERCF V2 platform.
To help our users better understand which STL files they need, weâ€™ve prepared a concise guide. We hope it will be helpful to you!
Thank you for your support!
